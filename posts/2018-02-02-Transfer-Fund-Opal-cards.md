So far I just know that there is *only one way* to transfer a balance of old Opal card to new Opal card. The reason I do that because I usually buy many Opal cards when my family visited me in Sydney. And then after they went back to Vietnam, I have to transfer all remaining balance of their Opal cards to my Opal cards. Here is the tip I have learned: 

## Should not use  `Report lost or stolen card` feature in mobile Opal app.

My learned lesson is you should not use `Report lost or stolen` in *Opal app in iPhone* because they have not supported to transfer balance from one card to other card yet. If you use that feature in the mobile app, you have to do one more step which is calling Opal supporters to help you. It wastes more time to do that because it's not easy to call Opal supporters during working hours. Sometimes you have to hold your phone and wait for more than 30 minutes. After you can connect to them, you have to answer some security questions.

## Use Opal Web app. 

1. Login to the Opal official website: https://www.opal.com.au/ (register a new account if you have not an account yet)

2. Click Report Opal card lost or stolen in left sidebar:

3. Click a big bottom right button - `Report card lost or stolen`

4. In next screens, you will choose:

   1. a Card you want to report lost/stolen â€”> this card will be blocked later on
   2. Next step you will choose a card you want to transfer the balance of the lost/stolen card to the new one. 

5. Done.

After done above steps, your new card will be topped up with new balance in 10-15 minutes. Happy travelling in NSW, Australia. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
