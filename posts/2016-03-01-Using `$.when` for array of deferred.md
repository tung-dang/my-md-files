There're a gotcha to watch out for when using jQuery API `$.when`. The following doesn't behave as you might hope:

```js

var promises = [
    $.ajax('http://google.com'),
    $.ajax('http://yahoo.com'),
    $.ajax('http://www.nytimes.com')
];

// NOTE: DON'T DO THIS!
$.when(promises)
    .then(function(results){
        console.log('All URLs fetched.');
    });

```

There are two problems here.

- First, `$.when` expects promises to be given as individual parameters, not as an array.
- Second, the results of the promises will be passed by `$.when` as individual parameters to the callback function, not as a single array of results.

To pass an array of promises to `$.when`, you therefore need to use `apply` method.

```js

var promises = [
    $.ajax('http://google.com'),
    $.ajax('http://yahoo.com'),
    $.ajax('http://www.nytimes.com')
];

$.when.apply($, promises).then(
    function(result1, result2, result3){
        console.log('All URLs fetched.');
    }
);

```
